# README: BLOG APP

I built the app following the Ruby on Rails Getting Started guide:
https://guides.rubyonrails.org/getting_started.html

This is the first time I'm trying to fill out a real ReadMe file and they say I should complete these fields, so I'll do my best.

* Ruby version: Ruby 3.1.2p20

* Rails version: Rails 7.0.4

* System dependencies: ??

* Configuration: ??

* Database creation: eeemmh there's SQLite and ProstgreSQL gems in here.

* Database initialization: ??

* How to run the test suite: no test suite set up.

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.): ??

* Deployment instructions: ??

* Well, I tried my best. I don't think I need to be more specific, specially since it's a simple blog app for me to grasp the basics of the MVC model and the configurations of a basic webapp with Rails (which is honestly surprisingly easy)
